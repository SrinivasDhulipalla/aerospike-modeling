# Aerospike CDT Examples moved to [aerospike-examples/aerospike-modeling](https://github.com/aerospike-examples/aerospike-modeling).

This repository contained examples of how to model using Aerospike's complex [data types](https://www.aerospike.com/docs/guide/data-types.html).

Please check out the new repo. I'll be pruning this one and keeping the README alone.
